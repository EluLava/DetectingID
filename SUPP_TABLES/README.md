# SUPPLEMENTARY TABLES

contains the supplementary tables S2 - S8 (S1 is in supplementary material text)

- Table S2: contains the RMSE for the four 'main' populations (PEDIGREE, EAS, AFR and WORLD) for the simple linear model (LM)

- Table S3: contains the RMSE for the four 'main' populations (PEDIGREE, EAS, AFR and WORLD) for the linear mixed model including the allele-sharing based relatedness matrix ($LMM_{AS}$)

- Table S4: contains the RMSE for the four 'main' populations (PEDIGREE, EAS, AFR and WORLD) for the linear mixed model including the relatedness based on the weighted version of GCTA ($LMM_^{w}_{GCTA}$)

- Table S5: contains the RMSE for the four 'main' populations (PEDIGREE, EAS, AFR and WORLD) for the linear mixed model including the relatedness based on the unweighted version of GCTA ($LMM_^{u}_{GCTA}$)


- Table S6: contains the number of simulation replicates ($n_{TOT}$ = 100) for which the model did which did not converge with the allele-sharing based relatedness matrix ($LMM_{AS}$)

- Table S7: contains the number of simulation replicates ($n_{TOT}$ = 100) for which the model did which did not converge with the relatedness based on the weighted version of GCTA ($LMM_^{w}_{GCTA}$)

- Table S8: contains the number of simulation replicates ($n_{TOT}$ = 100) for which the model did which did not converge with the relatedness based on the unweighted version of GCTA ($LMM_^{u}_{GCTA}$)
